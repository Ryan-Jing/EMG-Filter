# EMG-Filter
Prepare the signal of a standard EMG in a way that allows us to assess whether the muscle was contracted or not. Common issues encountered with EMG signals include interference and noise, which necessitate filtering them out. After the filtering process, we can proceed to develop a suitable metric for evaluating the muscle's status.
